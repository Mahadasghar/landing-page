# Landing Page Deployment

## Project Overview
This repository contains the source code for a simple landing page created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The landing page is deployed on an Nginx web server hosted on a remote VM.

## Steps to Set Up and Deploy

### 1. Create and Configure the Remote VM
- Provision a remote Virtual Machine (VM).
- Use SSH to connect to the VM via public/private key authentication.
  ```sh
  ssh -i your_private_key.pem user@your_vm_ip
  ```

### 2. Install and Configure Nginx
- Install Nginx on the VM:
  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install nginx -y
  ```
- Verify the installation by accessing the default Nginx page:
  ```sh
  http://your_vm_ip
  ```

### 3. Clone and Set Up the Repository
- Create a private GitHub repository named **landing-page**.
- Push your landing page files (HTML, CSS, JS) to the repository using git commands:
  ```sh
  git init
  git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/landing-page.git
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  git push -u origin main
  ```

### 4. Deploy the Landing Page on the VM
- On your VM, navigate to the web root directory:
  ```sh
  cd /var/www/html
  ```
- Clone the repository:
  ```sh
  sudo git clone https://github.com/your-username/landing-page.git
  ```
- Copy the contents of the repository to the Nginx web root:
  ```sh
  sudo cp -r landing-page/* /var/www/html/
  ```
- Restart Nginx to apply changes:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```

### 5. Access the Landing Page
- Open a web browser and enter the VM's IP address:
  ```sh
  http://your_vm_ip
  ```
- Your landing page should be visible.

## Notes
- Ensure that your VM allows HTTP traffic (port 80) through the firewall:
  ```sh
  sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
  sudo ufw enable
  ```
- If making changes, push updates to GitHub and pull them on the VM:
  ```sh
  git pull origin main
  sudo cp -r landing-page/* /var/www/html/
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```
